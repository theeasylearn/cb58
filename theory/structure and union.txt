introduction to structure
-------------------------------
structure is used to store different type of related value in single variable.
structure is special type of user defined datatype. structure is used to create special type of variable which has other variables of built in type or user defined type. each member variable in structure occupy separate(different) memory location
it is basically used to group related variable together. 
first we have to create structure using  struct keyword then only we can create variable of structure type. 
how to declare structure?
struct structure-name {
    //create variables (member variables)
    datatype name;
    datatype name;
    .............
};
we must create structure before void main function. 
example
struct student 
{
    //member variable 
    char name[32]; //string 
    int age;  //integer 
    float weight; //float 
    char gender; //char 
};
variable declared inside structure is called member variable.
how to declare structure type variable?
struct structure-name variable-name;
struct student s1;
how to take input inside structure member?
gets(s1.name);
scanf("%d",&s1.age);
scanf("%f",&s1.weight);
scanf("%c",&s1.gender);

how to display structure member?
printf("%d",s1.age);
printf("%f",s1.weight);
printf("%c",s1.gender);
puts(s1.name);

we can create array of structure. and we can also create array in structure.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Union?
    Union is also one type of user defined datatype. Union is also one kind of group related variable just like structure. but it has one big difference. members in union has shared memory location instead of different memory location. it means at a time only one member has data. if you store data in other member variable then data in previous member will be lost.

 union structure-name {
    //create variables 
    datatype name;
    datatype name;
    .............
};

example 
union marriage 
{
    char isMarried;
    int children;
}
rest of syntax for input, store, process, output will be same as structure.
