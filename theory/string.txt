what is string?
String means words like your name surname city address etc.
in c language string is sequence of letters that always ends with \0 (null). 
some example of string 
name,surname,address city etc 

there is no builtin datatype in to store string c language. so we use 1 dimension array of character to store string.

how to create string (1d array of char)?
char name[32],surname[32],address[512];

how to take input from user in string usinc scanf? 
example
1st we have to create 1d array of character type
char name[32] 
printf("enter your name"); //message 
scanf("%s",name); 

scanf function can accept string without space from user. if user give space scanf function will stop.

to accept string with sapce we must use gets function

example 

string address[512]

printf("enter your address");
gets(address); 

how to display string?
we can display string either using printf function or using puts function

example
printf("%s",name);
puts(address);


how to store many student names. to store many names (string) we can create array of string. 2d array of char is 1d array of string 
how to create 2d array of char?
char name[6][32];

how to create array of string?
-----------------------------------
1d array of char type is String. for example char name[32]. but this char array can store only one string. to store many string, we have to create 2d array of char type in 2d array of character type, 1st dimension is no of string means how many individual string we want store while 2nd dimension is used to give size of each string. means how many letters each string can store. let us understand by example 
    we want store 10 students name. each name can be of 32 characters

    char name[10][32]; 
    in this name 2d array we can store 10 individual student name each can be of 32 characters long.

how to take input from user in 2d char array 
for example we want to accept 1st student name 
printf("Enter 1st student name");
scanf("%s",name[0]); // we must give 1st dimension not second dimension
for example we want to accept 2nd student name
printf("Enter 2nd student name");
scanf("%s",name[1]); // we must give 1st dimension not second dimension
